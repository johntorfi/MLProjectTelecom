# Analysis of Customer Churn in Telecommunication Industry Using Decision Trees and Random Forests

## Introduction:
#### Customer churn, the phenomenon of customers discontinuing their services with a company, poses significant challenges for businesses in the highly competitive telecommunication industry. Understanding the factors that contribute to customer churn and developing effective strategies to mitigate it are crucial for maintaining customer loyalty and improving business profitability. In this study, we analyze a dataset from a telecommunication company to gain insights into customer churn and explore the predictive capabilities of decision trees and random forests algorithms.

## Insights and Findings:
#### The analysis reveals several valuable insights regarding customer churn. Firstly, higher monthly charges were found to be associated with increased churn rates, suggesting that pricing strategies should be carefully managed to retain customers. Additionally, customers with shorter tenure and lower total charges were more likely to churn, emphasizing the importance of building long-term relationships and providing value-added services. Furthermore, factors such as payment method, contract type, availability of online security and technical support, and age also showed significant correlations with churn.

## Algorithm and Results:
#### To predict customer churn and evaluate the performance of the algorithms, we employed decision trees and random forests. The decision tree algorithm employed a gini criterion with a maximum depth of 6 and a minimum samples leaf of 8. The resulting decision tree model achieved an accuracy of 93.17% on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting churn. Similarly, the random forests algorithm, utilizing 100 decision trees, yielded an accuracy of 93.17% on the same test dataset. These results highlight the robustness and reliability of both algorithms in predicting customer churn.

## Conclusion:
#### The analysis of customer churn in the telecommunication industry provides valuable insights for businesses seeking to enhance customer retention and reduce churn rates. By understanding the key factors influencing churn, such as pricing, contract terms, and service features, companies can devise targeted strategies to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. The decision tree and random forests algorithms showcased their predictive capabilities in identifying potential churners, enabling businesses to take proactive measures to retain at-risk customers. Ultimately, the findings of this study contribute to the body of knowledge in customer churn analysis and serve as a foundation for implementing data-driven strategies to mitigate churn and improve customer relationship management in the telecommunication industry.
